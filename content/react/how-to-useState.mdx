<Text>A basic example of how to use useState. Below is a live playground where you can edit the code. Try changing the count increment</Text>


```js react
def find_missing(sequence)
  consecutive     = sequence.each_cons(2)
  differences     = consecutive.map { |a,b| b - a }
  sequence        = differences.max_by { |n| differences.count(n) }
  missing_between = consecutive.find { |a,b| (b - a) != sequence }
  missing_between.first + sequence
end
find_missing([2,4,6,10])
```
